# Bank-App
Group Project:
*Debug Dolphins Bank App* 

Thank you for installing DDBs Banking app! 

To get started you’ll first need to login. We’ve provided you with two base admin accounts with the ability to add more user accounts, both with and without administrative privileges. 

**User 1**

Name: Reidar

Username: admin

Password: 123


**User 2**

Name: Aldor

Username: aldor

Password: 123


For security reasons we urge you to change the username and password of these accounts prior to commercial launch of the application
(Please note that the ability to do so will not be implemented in the provided alpha version of the application). 

When testing this product, since your provided user accounts do not come with pre-assigned bank accounts, you will first need to use the **Open New Account** function found in the **Account Info** menu.
In the Account Info menu, you can also quickly check your account **Balance**, view additional **Account Info** and show your **Transaction History**.  

Back in the Main Menu you can navigate to the **Transactions** menu, where you can make a **Deposit**, **Withdrawal**, **Transfer** money between your own bank accounts or make an **External Tranfer** to accounts of other users.
***PLEASE NOTE*** In order to make an **External Transfer** you will need to have access to the Account Number of the recipient’s account. the *Debug Dolphins Bank* does not disclose any information regarding other customers’ accounts for legal reasons. 

In the **Administration** menu you can **Add new User** and **Add new Admin** accounts, as well as **Set Exchange Rate** of other currencies relative to the value of SEK.
All options in **Administration** are only available to users with administrative privileges.
